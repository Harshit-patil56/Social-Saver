seven common color mistakes in UI design and how to fix them. The video focuses on transforming a poorly designed file management app into a refined one by applying better color principles.

Here are the key takeaways:

Too many colors: Using too many accent colors can make a design look confusing and cheap. The video suggests adhering to the 60-30-10 rule for dominant, secondary, and accent colors to create clarity. Icons generally don't need color unless they are communicating status.
Bad neutral balance: Bright colors should almost never be used for backgrounds. Instead, a neutral gray background with a light or white foreground is recommended. This also applies to dark mode, where darker colors are in the background. Sometimes, removing backgrounds altogether or using simple borders can create a cleaner UI.
Misusing brand colors: Designers can adapt brand colors by slightly rotating them on the color wheel to find analogous or complementary colors that work better for UI elements. This allows for better accessibility while maintaining brand identity.
Pure white & black: Instead of pure white or black, using dark grays for less important information and lighter grays for text can create a more sophisticated look.
Frankenstein dark mode: Dark mode should not simply be an inversion of light mode colors. It requires a distinct palette built with eye strain in mind, often utilizing light grays instead of pure white for text.
Ignoring semantic colors: Certain actions, like "delete," should use universally recognized colors like red, even if they aren't brand colors, to clearly communicate their destructive nature. Red is also commonly used for notifications.
Element states: Color can effectively communicate element states like disabled, hover, and active. For example, a slightly lighter color for hover states and a darker color for active states.



Professional Iconography and Color Palette: Replace emojis and overly bright, AI-selected colors with professional icon libraries (like Phosphor or Lucide) and a more sophisticated color scheme. Integrate data visualization through charts to add relevant information and visual appeal without cluttering the interface with unnecessary icons.

Optimized Layout Design: Rethink AI-generated layouts that tend to be repetitive and inefficient. Streamline sidebars, use account cards instead of generic profile circles, and consolidate menu items into easily accessible popovers.

Structured Feature Presentation: Enhance feature interfaces, which are often sparse when AI-generated. Employ modals for better organization, hide advanced options by default, and ensure all relevant fields and functionalities are present, allowing for easy expansion of features.

Clear and Purposeful Data Display: Eliminate purposeless elements often found in AI designs. For billing and usage pages, adopt clear, two-column layouts with simple charts. For pricing plans, present them logically, clearly showing discounts and outlining benefits of higher tiers.

Enriched Analytics and Data Visualization: Move beyond basic key performance indicators (KPIs) and simple charts. Implement features like toggles to compare specific data points, integrate more informative icons, and use richer visual representations such as shaded maps to display geographic data.

Engaging Landing Page Presentation: Crucial for user trust and conversion, landing pages should prioritize presentation over complexity. Incorporate relevant graphics, such as skewed link cards or edited screenshots of the application's refined internal pages, instead of generic icons, to establish a professional and trustworthy image.
